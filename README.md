## About Pricore

Managing private PHP packages should be simple. Pricore makes it that way. It provides a centralized, reliable way to store package metadata, control access with tokens, and integrate seamlessly with Git-based workflows.

With Pricore, teams gain full ownership of their package ecosystem while keeping dependency management fast, consistent, and transparent.

Don't want to self-host? Try [Hosted Pricore](https://app.pricore.dev) — a fully managed registry with zero setup.

### Why Pricore?

- **Stay in control** - Keep your private packages on your own infrastructure. No third-party servers, no external dependencies.
- **Skip the manual work** - Webhook-driven updates, a web dashboard, and full Composer v2 API support. Out of the box.
- **Use what you know** - Built on Laravel. If your team already knows the stack, you can run, extend, and contribute to Pricore from day one.

## Features

- **Git-Based Mirroring** - Point at any GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or generic Git repo. Automatic syncing via webhooks.
- **Monorepo Support** - Serve several packages from one repository by pointing Pricore at their directories, such as `packages/*`.
- **Registry Mirrors** - Import packages from Packagist or other Composer registries with dist mirroring.
- **Composer v2 Native** - Full API support with lightning-fast package resolves.
- **Security Auditing** - Vulnerability scanning via Packagist advisories with native `composer audit` support.
- **Web Dashboard** - Browse packages, manage tokens, and view download stats in realtime.
- **Built on Laravel** - Familiar stack, easy to extend. Open source under Apache 2.0.

## Quick Start with Docker

60 seconds to a working registry. Three commands. That's all it takes.

**1. Download the compose file**

```bash
curl -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pricorephp/pricore/main/docker-compose.yml
```

**2. Start the application**

Migrations and setup run automatically on first boot.

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

**3. Create your first user**

Then open `http://localhost:8000` and start adding packages.

```bash
docker compose exec app php artisan pricore:install
```

> The entrypoint automatically generates an `APP_KEY`, creates the SQLite database, runs migrations, and caches configuration on first boot. For production, you can provide your own `APP_KEY` via environment variable.

For manual installation, configuration, and production deployment guides, see the [documentation](https://docs.pricore.dev).
